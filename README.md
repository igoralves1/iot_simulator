Use cases for this AWS Solution:
> Improve remote device management with connected tools and scaled communication. Electronic product companies must securely onboard, organize, and monitor connected products. Once these products are deployed in the field, these companies must also manage remotely updating and scaling devices to meet workload requirements. Remote Device Management solutions on AWS easily connect devices or device fleets to the cloud. Once connected to the cloud, companies can remotely manage devices and scale communication between devices to enhance operations.
